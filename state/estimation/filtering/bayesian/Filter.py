class Filter(Estimation,abc.ABCMeta):
    '''
    - Is an estimation as the following:
    - Bayesian inference allows for estimating a state by combining a statistical processModel for a measurement (likelihood)
        with a prior probability using Bayesâ€™ theorem.
    - Byesian Filtering is a form of Estimation in which the intersection of measurement distribution and predicted, next
        state distribuation makes restricts the answer set
    - Byesian Filter refine estimates everytime a new measurement is achieved
    - In each Byesian Filter our goal is to compute the posterior which is state estimation after measurement (self.getPosterior)
    - first we predict () then we observe and update according to what is observed
    - What is the PDF of state with a given set of measurement
    - if the variables are normally distributed and the transitions are linear, the Bayes filtering becomes equal to
        the Kalman filtering.
